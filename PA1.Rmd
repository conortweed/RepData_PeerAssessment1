```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data

1. Loading the data
```{r loading data, echo=TRUE}
library(knitr)
setwd("~/Dropbox/coursera/ReproducibleResearch/Week2")

active_data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
str(active_data)
```
2. Converting date from factor -> Date

```{r processing data}
active_data$date <- as.Date(as.character(active_data$date))
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day (missing values ignored)?

1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day 
``` {r total steps}
tot_step_day <- tapply(active_data$steps, active_data$date, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
```

2. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
``` {r histogram}
hist(tot_step_day, breaks =10, xlab = "Total Number of Steps per Day", main = "Histogram of Total Steps per Day")
```

3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
``` {r mean and median}
mean_steps <- mean(tot_step_day)
median_steps <- median(tot_step_day)
```
The mean number of steps is `r mean_steps` and the median is `r median_steps` per day

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

1. Make a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
``` {r timeseries}
interval_steps <- aggregate(list(steps = active_data$steps), by = list(intervals = active_data$interval), FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)

plot(interval_steps$intervals, interval_steps$steps, type = "l", main = "Mean Number of Steps per Time Interval Across all Days", xlab = "5min Time Intervals", ylab = "Mean No of Steps")
```

2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
``` {r maxsteps}
max_steps <- which.max(interval_steps$steps)
max_interval <- interval_steps$intervals[max_steps]
```
The interval with the highest number of steps on average is `r max_interval`

## Imputing missing values

1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)
``` {r totalNAs}
tot_nas <- sum(is.na(active_data$steps))
```
The total number of missing values in the dataset is `r tot_nas`

2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset.
Values will be substituted using the mean for that interval

3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
``` {r replacingmissingvalues}
library("Hmisc")
active_data_new <- active_data
active_data_new$steps <- impute(active_data$steps, FUN = mean)
```

4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.
``` {r newhistogram}
hist(active_data_new$steps, breaks =10, xlab = "Total Number of Steps per Day", main = "Histogram of Total Steps per Day (Missing Replaced)")

mean_replace <- mean(active_data_new$steps)
median_replace <- median(active_data_new$steps)
```
The mean value of steps per day with the missing values replaced is `r mean_replace` and the median is `r median_replace`

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
``` {r weekdays}
active_data_new$weekdays <- as.factor(ifelse(weekdays(active_data_new$date)=="Saturday" | weekdays(active_data_new$date)=="Sunday", "weekend", "weekday" ))
```

2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).

``` {r weekdayplot}
library(dplyr)
week_steps <- active_data_new %>%
  group_by(interval, weekdays) %>%
  summarise(new_steps = mean(steps))

week_plot <- ggplot(week_steps, aes(x = interval, y = new_steps, col = weekdays)) +
                      geom_line() +
                      facet_wrap(~weekdays, ncol = 1, nrow=2)
                      
print(week_plot)

```
